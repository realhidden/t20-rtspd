T20L RTSP Server
==================

This project originally came from <https://github.com/beihuijie/carrier-rtsp-server>.

It's a very spartan RTSP server, using the live555 library for RTSP implementation,
and a FIFO file descriptor to feed the H.264 frames from the SDK example.
It's not robust, but it works.

This repo differs by making it work with lower memory devices using the T20L variant,
like the Xiaofang 1S. I have reverse-engineered the 1S binary in the firmware, 
and found undocumented SDK calls to increase the pool sizes in order to allow
the SDK to function under low memory.

The IR LEDs are now also software-controlled via PWM channel 0.
The settings were also reversed from the 1S binary, and should work with the 
WyzeCam v2 since they also got rid of the CdS photoresistor.

Also, you can find more technical information from the original 
[Dafang Hacks project](https://github.com/EliasKotlyar/Xiaomi-Dafang-Hacks).

Compilation (easy way)
============

With docker, in the project dir:
```
docker run --rm -ti -v $(pwd):/root/ debian
```

```
mkdir /build
cd /build
apt-get update
apt-get install -y p7zip wget git build-essential
wget https://github.com/Dafang-Hacks/Ingenic-T10_20/raw/master/resource/toolchain/mips-gcc472-glibc216-64bit-r2.3.3.7z
p7zip -d mips-gcc472-glibc216-64bit-r2.3.3.7z
export PATH=/build/mips-gcc472-glibc216-64bit/bin/:$PATH
cd ~
make
```

Compilation (harder way)
============

1. Download the T20 toolchain, either from [the Dafang-Hacks GitHub repo](https://github.com/Dafang-Hacks/Ingenic-T10_20/tree/master/resource/toolchain) or the [Tuya GitHub repo](https://github.com/TuyaInc/TUYA_IPC_SDK/tree/master/mips-linux-4.7.2_64Bit).

2. Set up the `PATH` environment variable to add the toolchain directory.

2. Clone this repo

3. Run the `make` command.
   You should end up with the `t20-rtspd` binary in the directory.
